GitHub and Git
--------------

Submitting changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `whatever model <https://help.github.com/articles/about-collaborative-development-models/>`_ you have access to and
feel comfortable with, but make sure to use a `Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_
approach unless otherwise instructed.

GitHub 2FA setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Be sure to activate two-factor authentication for GitHub:

.netrc
~~~~~~

To avoid entering password when pushing to GitHub, use a `.netrc` file.

Set it up with GPG encryption:
