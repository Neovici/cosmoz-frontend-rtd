Dependency management
=====================

Dependency definition files
---------------------------

Dependencies are defined in different files.

:file:`package.json`
--------------------

.. _installing-updating-component-dependencies:

Installing/updating component dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file is used by both the NPM and Yarn package managers. There are two
sections in this file regarding dependencies:

``dependencies`` section specifies the main dependecies and ``devDependencies``
section sets dependencies used during development, documentation or test.
Development dependencies are installed when doing ``npm link`` or
``npm install`` from the root of a package.

.. code:: json

    {
        "dependencies": {
            "<package>": "<version>"
        },
        "devDependencies": {
            "<package>": "<version>"
        }
    }

For more detailed information about dependencies in this file see the
documentation of it at `NPM <https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json>`_. Or
check the documentation for it at
`Yarn <https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/package-json/>`_.

:file:`bower.json`
------------------

This file is used by the Bower package manager and it has the same sections as
``package.json``. For more information, see the documentation for it on the
`Bower <https://github.com/bower/spec/blob/master/json.md>`_ repository on
GitHub (it's below the example file on that page).

Dependency versioning and naming
--------------------------------

Be sure to specify component versions like ``^1.0.0`` and not ``~1.1.3``.

If the component is depending on master, spell it out:

Use ``org/package#master`` instead of ``org/package``, ``org/package#\*`` or
``org/package#``.

If you have specifically tested the component with version 1.2.3, write
``^1.2.3`` to document that, even if ``^1.0.0`` will install the same version.

Any public components/repositories can only depend on publically available
components.

Installing component dependencies
---------------------------------

Make sure to install all dependencies for the *actual component(s)* in the repo,
do not confuse with :ref:`github-demo-dev-dependencies`.

Make sure to remove any dependencies not needed.

Install new dependencies with ``bower install --save org/package#^v1.0.0``.

Updating component dependencies
-------------------------------

Run ``bower update`` periodically to update the dependencies to the latest
version.

.. todo:: Replace bower dependency install/update with yarn equivalence.

.. _github-demo-dev-dependencies:

Installing demo/dev dependencies
--------------------------------

For any components/dependencies only needed for demo/dev, follow the above but
install with ``bower install --save-dev org/package#^v1.0.0``.

Bower link
----------

If developing two components that depend on each other, to avoid pushing
commits and running bower update all the time, use ``bower link``.

.. todo:: Replace bower link with yarn link.

Example
~~~~~~~

:ref:`cosmoz-omnitable` depends on :ref:`cosmoz-autocomplete` for filtering, but
:ref:`cosmoz-autocomplete` property change notification somehow doesnâ€™t work in
that context and needs to be tested, debugged and fixed with both
components in parallel::

    $ cd cosmoz-autocomplete
    $ bower link
    $ cd ../cosmoz-omnitable
    $ bower link cosmoz-autocomplete

Now the ``cosmoz-omnitable/bower_components/cosmoz-autocomplete`` will be
linked to the local :ref:`cosmoz-autocomplete` repo, causing any changes to be
available in :ref:`cosmoz-omnitable` instantly.

.. note::

    This will cause the linked component to not update with ``bower update``,
    instead a ``git pull`` is needed in that repo.

    When a link is no longer needed, you should therefore ``bower uninstall
    <dependency-package>`` before running ``bower update`` to make sure all
    dependencies are updated properly.
