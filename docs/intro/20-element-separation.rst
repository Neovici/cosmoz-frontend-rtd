Element separation
------------------

Element names starting with ``cosmoz-`` are public elements (:ref:`cosmoz-elements`) hosted at GitHub.
Public elements are stored in the ``app/bower_components`` directory of the source tree.
Changes to these elements are done by pull requests in their respective GitHub repos followed by a dependency update, for more information see :ref:`installing-updating-component-dependencies`.

Element names starting with ``cz-`` are only available in the Cosmoz frontend repo.
These elements are stored in the ``app/polymer`` directory of the source tree.
Changes to these elements are done directly in the directories.
